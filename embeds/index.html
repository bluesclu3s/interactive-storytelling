    <h2> Kendrick's Superbowl Halftime Show </h2>
<p> If you watched the Superbowl or you've been on social media this weekend, you probably know that people had a lot to say about Kendrick's halftime show. From formations representing the American flag and appearances from other stars like SZA, Serena Williams, and Samuel Jackson as Uncle Sam, the show was full of a clear artistic direction.</p>

<p>Not Like Us, the last song of his set, elicited cheers from the stadium for "a minor," one of the most popular lines of the song.</p>

    <h2> "Not Like Us" Wins Big at the Grammy's</h2>
<p> Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" clearly struck a chord after sweeping Grammys in all five categories it was nominated in. This included Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance, Best Rap Song, and Best Music Video (phew!). </p>

<p> "Not Like Us" is just one of the songs born from the rap beef between K-Dot and Drake that swept the internet this summer.</p>

    <li> "Push-Ups" - Drake; April 19, 2024</li>

<p> Not Like Us went on to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 100 and hit a billon Spotify streams in January. Aside from the numbers, there was clearly a larger cultural influence the song had, especially with Kendrick's Not Like Us performance in LA that brought together members from opposing gangs onto the same stage. </p>
<p>Safe to say, most people believe Kendrick won the battle. </p>

<h3> Reflection</h3>
<p>My experience using the embeds was fine, I was just having trouble narrowing down the story I wanted to focus on. I was originally doing it about the Grammy's, but with Kendrick's Supwerbowl performance this weekend, I decided to shift gears. The first embed I used was a video I made in Canva. It is fairly simple, but I thought it was visually pleasing, especially because it's the same color as the header. </p>
<p> The next embed I used was a tweet that I found exactly showing a moment in the superbowl that I was talking about in the preceding paragraph. The GIFs were really easy to use and embed, and I think they also make it more engaging because music videos are supposed to be fun and catch attention. They also served as nice transitions between grafs.</p>
<p> Lastly, I thought it would be a good idea to embed songs because I was listing them out. I was having a bit of trouble with the Spotify embeds because sometimes it was showing an error code because there were too many embeds on this one single page. I searched up how to resolve it and they said to just wait a while before putting in again.</p>
