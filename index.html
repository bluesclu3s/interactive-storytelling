       <p> The fires that are sweeping over Southern California this week could be
        exacerabted by a phenomenon called "<a

      <h3>
        What is weather whiplash?
      </h3>
  
      <p> The phenomenon depends on these three things:
      <ul>
        <li>wet period 💧 </li>
        <li>dry spell  🌬️ </li>
        <li>quick turnover between the two 🔄 </li>
      </ul></p>
     <p> 
    The last rainfall in California was eight months ago. After new growth from the rain, the dry spell has set up the perfect conditions for dried vegetation to catch on fire.
      </p>
      
  <p>
    This, in combination with volatile winds, have caused fires to spread across the Palisades and Eaton. The 
    <a href= "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-01-12/death-toll-palisades-eaton-fires-rises;">LA Times</a> reported 25 deaths as
    of Monday night.
